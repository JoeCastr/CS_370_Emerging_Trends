Emerging trends in AI

## My contribution to this code
In the TreasureHuntGame notebook, most of the code was provided, including the two supporting classes in separate .py files. The logic that I added as part of the project was within the qtrain function. The logic added served the purpose of evaluating each move made by the pirate, intaking the reward, and assessing the reward of both past and future choices.

## Ethical responsibilities of engineers working with AI
To the organization I work for, I believe it's my responsiblity to voice concerns about the security and exposure of people's data. As an individual contributor, I can't act against the orders of my boss without being at risk of getting fired. This imbalance of power will ensure that the will of capital is done, no matter the cost to society. Unless a whole bunch of us engineers use our collective power as the true value-producers within corporations to refuse to carry out their will when it violates ethical standards, workers have little power to guide AI practices ethically.
